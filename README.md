## Usage
The Writing Prompt Generator API exposes a single endpoint at `/api/v1/prompts`. This endpoint accepts optional `genre` and `theme` parameters.

It is required that a user have both an OpenAI API key as well as a Writing Prompt Generator (WPG) API key in order to hit this endpoint and receive a valid response. The former can be obtained via the OpenAI developer platform. The latter is available only on request.

## Features
- Node
- Express
- ChatGPT 4o-mini

## Tests
The Writing Prompt Generator API uses Vitest for unit testing. Once the repository has been cloned and dependencies have been installed with `npm i`, the suite of unit tests can be run via the `npm run test` command.
