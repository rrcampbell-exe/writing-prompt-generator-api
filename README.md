## Usage
The Writing Prompt Generator API exposes a single endpoint at `/api/v1/prompts`. This endpoint accepts an optional `genre` parameter.

As this API pings the OpenAI API, users must have a valid OpenAI API key in order to successfully hit the endpoint. This will remain the case until the API is deployed to production.

Even once that deployment takes place, the API will only accept requests during local development or, later, those sent from ryanrcampbell.com.
